Problem Definition\n\nIn a statement,\n> Given neighborhood details of the city of Toronto such as different venues, category of the venues can we cluster the neighborhoods \nbased on the city's food diversity?\n\n**Audience/ stakeholders who might be interested in this project:**\nFood plays a major role in sorting out various people/cultures within a city as people prefer various cuisines based on their culture and ethnicity.\nSo this project can be used by various culture based vendors to start a new business based on the cultural preference in a specific neighborhood.\nAlso someone who is looking to open a new restaurant in the neighborhoods of Toronto can use this analysis or model to understand the food preferences."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2. Data\n\n### Neighborhood details of Toronto\n\nThe data set consists of the list of postal codes in Canada where the first letter is M. Postal codes beginning with M are located within the city of Toronto in the province of Ontario. Only the first three characters are listed, corresponding to the Forward Sortation Area.\n\nThe data set used for the below problem is available in wikipedia.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n\n**Features:**\n\nPostal Code - Postal code of the Neighborhood.\n\nBorough - Borough to which the neighborhood belongs.\n\nNeighborhood - Name of the Neighborhood\n\n### Geographical Coordinates\n\nInorder to explore the nighborhoods using the Foursquare API, we need the geographical coordinates of neighborhoods.\nThis data is available in https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data.\n\n### Foursquare API\n\nAfter retrieving the data set from wikipedia and formatted it, we will be using the Foursquare (location data provider) API to explore each nighborhoods and cluster them based on the food pracices/diversity.\n\n**Some of the features retrieved using Foursquare API:**\n\nCategories - Category of the venue\n\nCategory ID - unique ID for the category\n\nName - Name of the venue and so on."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
